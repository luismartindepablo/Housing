# Housing

Walk through **Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project** from the book "*Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*, 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron (O'Reilly)". Copyright 2019 Kiwisoft S.A.S., 978-1-492-03264-9.

In this project we'll use a California housing prices dataset from the California 1990 census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. The dataset includes metrics such as the population, median income and median housing price for each block group in California, which are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data. The model must learn from this data and be able to predict the meadian housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.

The project consists on a typical multiple regression learning task.
